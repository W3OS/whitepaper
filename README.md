#Web3OS

Modified 11/26/2021
## Adaptation
The advancements of decentralized technologies starting with simple distributed ledger platforms such as Bitcoin that have since evolved into complex data processing platforms (Ethereum/Smart Contract Platforms) have established the infrastructure of the next generation of digital environments. 

The modern internet, or Web2, has evolved into the genesis of action and thought every day across the World. The infrastructure supporting these efforts is centralized and risks exposure to malicious actors influencing the outcomes of daily actions and public consensus for monetary or political gain.

The goal for decentralized technologies is to remove the risk associated with centralized authorities and create an open environment through permissionless and trustless consensus. 

**Data = Data**

Decentralized applications (dAPPs) are launched every day promoting this open and fair philosophy. However, the way that we interact with these dAPPs still originates from a heavily centralized environment starting with the user’s operating system.

## Goal
The goal is to create a user-friendly open-source Linux-based operating system directly tethered to the Web3 ecosystem. All Web3 applications require the user to have a wallet to interact with the application’s underlying smart contract. The user’s wallet is their digital identity / shared account across the Web3 ecosystem. 

**The user’s operating system should be tethered to their digital identity.**

## Core Concepts (daemons)
- **Identity**
  The user-access to the operating system will be the user’s Web3 wallet. ENS could be used for the username, with the password being their seed phrase / USB.
  *Web2.0 Variant: Microsoft/O365 Account / iCloud Account*
- **File Management**
  Other than Linux being a rock-solid foundation for any OS, the “everything is a file” architecture of Linux gives immense flexibility to state-changes of user folder directories that will be connected via IPFS / Filecoin.
  *Web2.0 Variant: Microsoft OneDrive / iCloud Drive*
- **Network Node**
  Whichever Web3 network chosen by the user, the device should become a node itself to remove exposure from public gateways / endpoints.
- **Communication**
  Electronic Mail (eMail) is terrible. There is an opportunity to integrate a new communication standard built directly into Web3OS.
- **More?**
